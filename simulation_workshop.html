			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>The goal of this interdiscplinary workshop is to discuss advances in research on mental simulation in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and linguistics. Major themes will include definitions, mechanisms, and applications of simulation across these interdisciplinary fields.</p>
			<p>Mental simulation, simply stated, concerns how humans run models in the mind of external processes or states. This occurs continually in everyday cognition. For example, mentally rehearsing how to hit a baseball before actually hitting it or replaying the sound of fingernails on the blackboard. Mental simulation has become an important research topic in many fields, including philosophy, psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, computational science, and literature. Some aspects of simulation are heavily debated, including the extent to which mental simulation is grounded in or linked to physical action and perception, the mechanisms that drive it, and its utility in everyday life. Research on mental simulation has occurred primarily within, not across disciplines, even though interdisciplinary work would lead to deeper insights and advance theory in this area.</p>
			<p>We are bringing together experts and interested researchers with very different approaches to studying mental simulation. This will hopefully lead to a new understanding on what common features underlie what we think of as mental simulation, and motivate new directions for exploring the definitions, mechanisms, and applications of simulation.</p>

			<h3>General Information</h3>
			<p>The 2018 Mental Simulation Workshop will be held on Tuesday, October 2nd at the University of California, Merced campus.</p>
			<p>The workshop will include invited talks from distinguished researchers in the field of mental simulation and extended working groups aimed at facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
			<p>Organizers intend to assemble a guest issue in an interdisciplinary scientific journal to disseminate new theoretical and applied views based on working group discussions. In addition, participants are encouraged to join in grant proposals and other inter-campus collaborations.</p>
