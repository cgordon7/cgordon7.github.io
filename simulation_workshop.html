			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The goal of this interdiscplinary workshop is to discuss advances in research on mental simulation in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience and linguistics. Major themes will include definitions, mechanisms, and applications of simulation across these interdisciplinary fields.</p>
			<p>Mental simulation, simply stated, concerns how humans run models in the mind of external processes or states. This occurs continually in everyday cognition. For example, mentally rehearsing how to hit a baseball before actually hitting it or replaying the sound of fingernails on the blackboard. Mental simulation has become an important research topic in many fields, including philosophy, psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, computational science, and literature. Some aspects of simulation are heavily debated, including the extent to which mental simulation is grounded in or linked to physical action and perception, the mechanisms that drive it, and its utility in everyday life. Research on mental simulation has occurred primarily within, not across disciplines, even though interdisciplinary work would lead to deeper insights and advance theory in this area.</p>
			<p>We are bringing together experts and interested researchers with very different approaches to studying mental simulation. This will hopefully lead to a new understanding on what common features underlie what we think of as mental simulation, and motivate new directions for exploring the definitions, mechanisms, and applications of simulation.</p>

			<h3>Interdisciplinarity of Simulation</h3>
			<p>Research in embodied and situated cognition depends on understanding how mental simulations underlie perception, learning, and reasoning (Barsalou, 2009). This perspective is increasingly influential throughout the psychological and behavioral sciences.</p>
			<p>Research in linguistics has explored how mental simulation unfolds in time with ongoing sentences (Anderson et al., 2008; Matlock, 2004). Other work by our group has also shown that learned words are recalled by re-instantiating the sensorimotor interaction and context at the time of learning, likely via simulations of that context and interaction (Gordon et al., submitted). Experiments bridging neuroscience and semantics have revealed that when particular words are processed, the modality-specific brain regions that are most relevant to the semantics of the word are activated (e.g., Pulvermuller, 2005).</p>
			<p>Work on simulation in neuroscience suggests that humans simulate the actions of observed others, using the neural regions responsible for generated actions ourselves (Iacoboni, 2009). This has had powerful implications for theories of social and affective neuroscience, where simulation is thought to arise through means of empathy (Decety & Grezes, 2006). Furthermore, research on individuals recovering from stroke finds facilitated recovery of limb movement when treatment includes phases of movement simulation, or motor imagery (Ietswaart et al., 2011).</p>
			<p>Philosophers have also built upon these ideas, suggesting that simulation underlies both mind-reading (or understanding what others’ goals are) (Gallese & Goldman, 1998) and self-other distinction (Jeannerod & Pacherie, 2004).</p>
			<p>In human-computer interaction and user experience applications, research on mental simulation can improve predictions of user’s mental states and behavior, and potentially suggest better ways to interact with and support humans.</p>

			<h3>Research Outcomes</h3>
			<p>This workshop will facilitate new collaborative research between graduate and faculty researchers. We intend to assemble a guest issue in an interdisciplinary scientific journal to disseminate new theoretical and applied views based on working group discussions. In addition, discussion groups may result in grant proposals or other inter-campus collaborations.</p>
