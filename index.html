			<p><b><u>About Me</u></b></p>
				<p>
				I am a Learning and Data Scientist, analyzing complex data and helping create personalized and engaging learning
					experiences for kids and find ways 
					to share information about kids' learning abilities and performance with their educators and families. I
					do this by executing computational simulations of learner behavior, applying latent trait estimation
					algorithms, and working cross-functionally with clients, engineers, and our product group in order to ensure
					that partner company products meet expectations.
				</p> <p> I have a strong background in Cognitive Science, Neuroscience and Linguistics, and extensive experience with
					experimental research methods, advanced statistical modeling (mixed models, latent trait models, nonlinear data
					analysis), and programming in R and Python.
				</p><p>
					I completed my PhD studying how the motor system of the brain and our bodies contribute to perception, cognition, and empathy.
				</p>

				<p> I am interested in understanding how the motor system of the brain and body, which controls our actions, contribute to non-motor tasks. These include visual and auditory perceptual tasks, as well as higher cognitive functions, with an emphasis on word learning. My research tools of choice are gamified virtual reality experiments and transcranial magnetic stimulaion.</p> 
				<p> More recently, I have been extending knowledge of how movement influences cognition, social affiliation, and emotion, to research how movement can be used to positively impact social connectedness and increase empathy among humans. 
				<p>I am also interested in the embodied nature of language and understanding how language learning relies on the sensorimotor system, and in how the sensorimotor nature of concrete concepts eventually give rise to abstract language and concepts. Furthermore, I would like to understand how these embodied concepts are accessed in conversation. </p>

        <br></br>
	<p><u>Early Education Cognitive Digital Assessment Design</u></p>
<p>
Current cognitive assessments for young children are labor-intensive on the part of educators and prone to subjective biases, limiting the utility of the
data these assessments could generate.
As a learning scientist, I designed gamified cognitive tasks to measure student learning enabling our client to release a digital
assessment platform for early education language skills. This platform empowers educators to assess young children more quickly and accurately, while
improving the overall engagement with learning by including fun stories and immersive environments.
My primary role on this project was to identify and translate current assessment paradigms into accessible digital designs and engage with a crossfunctional
team of engineers, product designers, and client executives to implement the platform.
</p>
		
        <br></br>
	<p><u>Optimizing Engagement and Calibrating Precision of Adaptive Digital Assessments</u></p>
	<p>
	Gamified testing tools need to be calibrated for precision, but for adaptive tools, collecting the data to calibrate is
	a time-consuming and expensive process. While calibration is essential, the overall flow and engagement of the experience
	must also be maintained.
	To address these challenges, I developed a computational framework for simulation of learner behavior using R. The framework
	enables us to measure the performance of content recommendation algorithms, which can reduce the number of questions needed for
	assessments and improve the overall accuracy. In addition, we can apply constraints to external parameters to improve the continuity
	and engagement of the experience.
	</p>
	<p><i>
	Mental simulation is ubiquitous, yet definitions of what simulation means
	vary from researcher to researcher and even more so from research domain to research domain. Furthermore, a consensus on the underlying
	mechanisms of mental simulation still evade us. I am interested in understanding what simulation as a process shares across domains such
	as music listening, language processing, action observation, and sensorimotor prediction.
	</i></p>
	<p><u>Building VR Games to Study Immersive Language Learning</u></p>
	<p>
	Language is highly embodied and situated in the environments in which it is used. Researchers have shown that neural regions corresponding to
	actual perception/motor acts are also active while processing language about these perceptions and motor acts. Yet we have few experimental
	methods that can actually demonstrate the process by which concepts become embodied during learning.
	</p><p>
	I designed and executed a series of experiments investigating how the affordances available while learning new words influence how those
	words are grounded in our bodies and in corresponding neural areas responsible for actions. Using mixed-effects models to account for
	nested variation within and between subjects, I demonstrated that participants rapidly acquire new embodied word associations in an
	immersive virtual reality environment.

        <br></br>
	<p><u>Stimulating the Brain to Study Learning and Sensorimotor Prediction</u></p>
        <p>
	Many experiments have shown that motor regions of the brain are active during perception of others' actions, as well as sensory prediction of
	spatiotemporal information like rising and falling pitch. I designed and conducted experiments using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to
	study how motor areas of the brain learn to predict during these sensorimotor tasks. TMS is a tool for studying the brain that allows researchers
	to probe the neural activity in the cortical motor network, which measures the strength of sensorimotor associations and can act as a rough measure
	of current "readiness-to-act". I collected multimodal demographic, behavioral, and neural data, developed filtering and preprocessing analytic
	processes, and applied statistical models including mixed-effects, repeated-measures ANOVA, and power analyses.

	<p><u>Interactions Between Motor Learning and Language Learning</u></p>
        <p>While a lot of work in the linguistic domain looks at embodied language, most theories of motor control don’t account for effects of language on motor
		tasks. Another VR task developed by myself and a few collaborators looks at motor learning in a 3-dimensional virtual world and examines the effect
		that linguistic labels has on motor learning. Other work I’ve been involved in has shown particularly interesting relationships between motor
		learning improvement and improvement in learning a linguistic label. </p>
